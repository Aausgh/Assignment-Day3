                    The Kawasaki Ninja 1000 SX (sold in some markets as the Ninja 1000, Z1000S or Z1000SX) 
                    is a motorcycle in the Ninja series from the Japanese manufacturer Kawasaki sold since 2011. 
                    Other than its name, it is unrelated to the Ninja 1000R produced from 1986-89, or to other 
                    Ninja motorcycles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is generally characterized as a fully faired sibling of the Z1000 streetfighter, 
                    sharing the same 1,043cc liquid-cooled, electronic fuel-injected, 16-valve four-stroke 
                    inline-four engine and aluminum twin-tube backbone frame, but with ergonomics, storage, 
                    larger fuel tank and other design elements more oriented to the sport touring market. 
                    The Ninja 1000 is also fitted with an electronic speed limiter, not because it is capable 
                    of exceeding the 300 km/h (186 mph) agreed to in the gentlemen's agreement but apparently to 
                    keep its top speed the same as the unfaired and unlimited Z1000.

                Kawasaki has positioned the bike as a "sport bike for the real world. As the model will not 
                be homologated for racing purposes, the designers were free to make compromises for street 
                performance. The Ninja 1000 thus has an upright seating position, large fuel tank, and 
                adjustable windscreen among its features, as well a transmission geared for street-riding 
                as opposed to racing. Nevertheless, it retains the large engine and aggressive styling 
                of a sport bike, and its performance characteristics remain on the sport end of the spectrum, 
                placing its sports-touring type more in competition with bikes like the Honda VFR1200F or 
                Triumph Sprint GT as opposed to the Kawasaki's Concours or Yamaha FJR1300.
